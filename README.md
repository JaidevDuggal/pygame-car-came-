# 🐍 Legacy Project: Pygame Challenge (12th Grade)

### 🚀 The Start of the Journey
This repository holds a simple game developed using **Python's Pygame library**. This was my very first attempt at building a complete application, marking the beginning of my journey into programming during my **12th grade**.

### 💡 Why is this here? (The Pivot)
Though my primary focus has now shifted to **Financial Automation 📈** (Audit, Tax & Compliance), I keep this project as a reminder of two things:

1.  **Long-Term Commitment:** It demonstrates my **genuine and long-standing passion** for Python, a language I now leverage to drive efficiency in the CA profession.
2.  **Problem Solving:** Building a game, like building an automation script, requires **breaking down complex problems** into simple, executable logic.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Status
- **Core Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame
- **Project Status:** This project is archived. It is kept here solely for **historical context** and to show my foundational skills.

*(Note: The environment dependencies are old, so the game may not run directly on modern systems. Please view the code structure.)*
